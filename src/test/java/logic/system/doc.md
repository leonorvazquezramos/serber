# Systems

## Of Authors, Classes and Natures

**Author** - Who created the System. (If System.author !null, then this System is an Artifact (result of a Process)).
* human - man-made artifact (a.k.a. artificial)
* natural - non-man-made artifact


**Class** - In the System Hierarchy.
* root - base of the System. Its State == Whole.State. Can only be *natural* as any *root* System with an Author of type "human" will be a Simulation by definition and not a Universe.
* simple - has no constituents
* complex - has constituents and is not base of the System


**Nature** - How the System Properties are perceived
* abstract - perceivable by the mind only
* concrete - perceivable by the physical senses via physical media channels

| 1   | human   | root    | abstract | FALSE    | root Systems can be only natural by definition                 |
| 2   | natural | root    | abstract | FALSE    | root System can´t be abstract as is instantiated               | Physical Systems              |
| 3   | human   | complex | abstract | TRUE     | e.g. Work place relationship dynamics                          | Social constructs             |
| 4   | natural | complex | abstract | FALSE    | there are no abstract natural objects (abstract implies human) | Emotions                      |
| 5   | human   | simple  | abstract | TRUE     | e.g. any abstract concept that can not be decomposed           | Abstract concepts             |
| 6   | natural | simple  | abstract | FALSE    | there are no abstract natural objects (abstract implies human) |                               |
| 7   | human   | root    | concrete | FALSE    | root Systems can be only natural by definition                 |                               |
| 8   | natural | root    | concrete | TRUE (1) | only Universe                                                  | Universe                      |
| 9   | human   | complex | concrete | TRUE     | e.g. any mechanical artifact                                   | Engineered artifacts          |
| 10  | natural | complex | concrete | TRUE     | e.g. Solar System                                              |                               |
| 11  | human   | simple  | concrete | TRUE     | e.g. Fork                                                      |                               |
